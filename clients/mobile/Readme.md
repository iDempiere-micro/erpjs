This is a blank svelte-native project template. It has preprocessing with typescript support enabled. It provides an easy way to get started with a svelte native project.

# Usage

You can get started with this using `degit`:

```bash
npx degit halfnelson/svelte-native-template myapp
cd myapp
npm install
```

Your svelte-native app will be found in the `myapp` folder.

Once installed use the `ns preview`, `ns build` or `ns run` commands as for a normal NativeScript application.

Example: install & run application on your device:

```bash
ns run android
# or
ns run ios
```
