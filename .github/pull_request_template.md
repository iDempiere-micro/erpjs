_Writing the merge request description helps to share your code faster)_

# TL;DR

_Please explain in one line what is this merge request about_

# Proof
_(before we let the code in, we would like to know it works. You already tested the change so why not document it and show the others as well?_ 
_Examples: picture of the Networks tab showing the requests, animated gif, short video)._

_(describe what was the code state before the MR and what is the current behavior._
_Examples: The `/products` API client was missing and is needed for further development)_

# How you fixed what was wrong
_(this is the most important part of the MR description._ 
_We already know what was wrong and if we read the issue connected we know where you want to get._ 
_Looking at the code we will also know what you wrote. So please explain **why** you did it this way._ 
_Examples: I decided to keep the list of the blembas in the store as we use it on more occasions in the application.)_
