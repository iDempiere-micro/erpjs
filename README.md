# [EolERP  - the headless serverless ERP and CRM for the cloud](https://github.com/iDempiere-micro/erpjs/wiki)

## Introduction
This is the source code of [EolERP](https://github.com/iDempiere-micro/erpjs/wiki), the headless serverless ERP and CRM for the cloud 
written in TypeScript running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and 
in a browser as an [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) single page application. 

It can run on your local computer, in a containerized environment like Kubernetes (K8) 
on Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure or IBM Cloud or even as a serverless function in AWS.

[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), Open Source Identity and Access Management is used for the authentication 
so you can even get advanced features such as User Federation, Identity Brokering and Social Login.

## I want to quickly test by myself
Cool! You can either use or [Quick Setup Guide](https://github.com/iDempiere-micro/erpjs/wiki/Quick-setup) or see the demo (once it is ready).

## Benefits
You can download the source code and own the ERP&CRM.
You can explore the source code and find out how we used [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), 
[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/), [GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) 
to both build the backend that can run in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and 
a sample frontend application that can be immediately used to run a business.

You can run the ERP&CRM in your own cloud provided by AWS and both keep your data safe and prevent bad things 
happening by having all your important data on your laptop or own server.

## Current status
Currently we have the sales invoicing flow completed so you can add customers, products etc. and create and print the sales invoices (the invoices you are sending to your customers to get money). So something like an online invoice generator is already completed.
