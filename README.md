# [MaeERP  - the headless serverless ERP and CRM for the cloud](https://github.com/iDempiere-micro/erpjs/wiki)

This is the source code of MaeERP, the headless serverless ERP and CRM for the cloud 
written in TypeScript running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and 
in a browser as an [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) single page application. 

It can run on your local computer, in a containerized environment like Kubernetes (K8) 
on Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure or IBM Cloud or even as a serverless function in AWS. 

[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), Open Source Identity and Access Management is used for the authentication 
so you can even get advanced features such as User Federation, Identity Brokering and Social Login.

You can download the source code and own the ERP&CRM.
You can explore the source code and find out how we used [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), 
[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/), [GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) 
to both build the backend that can run in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and 
a sample frontend application that can be immediately used to run a business.

You can run the ERP&CRM in your own cloud provided by AWS and both keep your data safe and prevent bad things 
happening by having all your important data on your laptop or own server.
